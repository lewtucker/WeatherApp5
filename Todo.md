I would like to build a simple web application demo to allow a user to find out the weather for a given city along with point of interest such as restaurants, parks, shopping, etc.  Keep it simple, using HTML/CSS/JS.  Use free services where available.  I have an API key for OpenWeatherMap.  
Layout should include a search field for the user to input a city name.  Start with a default city based on the user’s geolocation. Display the current weather, a map of the city, and another user input selection for searching points of interest.

Build this incrementally, allowing the user to first see the general layout before adding functionality.  Then add feature by feature.

Technology stack might include HTML/CSS and Javascript, OpenWeatherMap, leaflet, OpenStreetMAP Overpass, Tailwind CSS or any others that might be applicable.

Write out a CLAUD.MD file, keep a transcript in Transcript.md, and write a README.md to contain instructions for running the app.

Also, enable this for creating a repository on Github.
